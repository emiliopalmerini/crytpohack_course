Welcome to my personal repository containing comprehensive Jupyter Notebook notes for the CryptoHack course. This repository is a personal collection, primarily designed as a unique reference for my learning journey in cryptography.

## Key Features:

- **Personalized Notes:** Each notebook is a reflection of my individual learning process throughout the CryptoHack course, tailored to my understanding and perspectives.
- **Interactive Format:** As an interactive notebook, it allows me to experiment and run Python code directly, facilitating an active learning experience.
Unique Insights: My notes may offer a different viewpoint or approach to cryptographic concepts, potentially beneficial for those looking for alternative explanations.
- **Subjective Understanding:** Since these notes are personalized, they might be more aligned with my thought process and may not always align with conventional explanations.
- **Continuous Learning:** This repository is a living document of my ongoing exploration in cryptography, constantly evolving with my growing understanding.
Please note that as these notes are tailored to my learning style and comprehension, they might be less straightforward for external readers. This repository is more a personal learning diary than a structured educational resource.

Feel free to explore and gain insights into how I have tackled the complex world of cryptography, but keep in mind the subjective nature of these notes.
