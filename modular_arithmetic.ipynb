    "1. Integers modulo p: When we talk about \"integers modulo p\", we refer to the set of all integers considered within a certain number, called the modulus. In this case, the modulus is a prime number \"p\". For example, if \"p\" is 5, the integers modulo 5 would be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n",

When \"p\" is a prime number, the integers modulo \"p\" form a field. This means that we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide these numbers in a way that respects the standard properties of these operations. The field formed by the integers modulo a prime number \"p\" is denoted as Fp. `A finite field Fp is the set of integers {0,1,...,p-1}, and under both addition and multiplication there is an inverse element b for every element a in the set, such that a + b = 0 and a * b = 1`\n",

    "3. A ring if the modulus is not prime: A ring is another algebraic structure, similar to a field but with fewer requirements. If the modulus \"n\" is not a prime number, then the integers modulo \"n\" form a ring, not a field. This means that while addition and multiplication are still well-defined and have familiar properties, division might not always be possible.\n",
